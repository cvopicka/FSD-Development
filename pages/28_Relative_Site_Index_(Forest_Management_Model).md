# Relative Site Index (Forest Management Model)

Site index can be broken in to 3 basic sections.  the first section is the small tree growth.  the second 2 are the large tree component.

Section 1

this is the small tree portion.  while it is dificult to model small trees this section will be plugable so that better models can be used.  for the purposes of this model this section will be a time scalar to reach the point of maximum growth.

Section 2

this is the most productive section of the tree.  this piece will vary in location of the tree but will represent maximum height growth potential.  this value will be used as one of the indexing values.  this should also be out of the zone of silvicultural manipulation such as in section 1.

Section 3

the asimptote.  trees slow off after CMAI has been achieved.  this is the value of that reduction.  represented in % of previous growth step.
